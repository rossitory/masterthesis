## Title
Development of a Software Application to Support Therapeutic Processes through the Creation of a Personal Timeline of Traumatic Life Events

## Introduction
In today’s society, mental health and therapeutic support are becoming increasingly important. Many individuals experience traumatic events that can adversely affect their quality of life and mental well-being. This work aims to develop a software application that serves as a support tool for preparing for therapeutic sessions. This application will enable users to document their traumatic events in a visual timeline, fostering structured reflection and providing better access to their experiences.

## Problem Statement
Documenting and processing traumatic life events often presents challenges. Many clients feel insecure or overwhelmed when articulating their experiences. The developed software aims to provide a user-friendly platform that helps users chronologically represent their events, thereby facilitating preparation for therapy discussions and improving communication with therapists.

## Objectives
The objective of this work is to develop a prototype of a software application that:
1. Enables users to create a personal timeline of traumatic experiences.
2. Provides a structured and visual representation to make experiences more understandable.
3. Offers opportunities for reflection and sharing with therapists.

## Scientific Framework
This work will draw on theoretical approaches from psychology, particularly:
- Narrative Psychology
- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
- Trauma Theories

Additionally, an examination of the ethical aspects of the application and data protection will be necessary to safeguard users' sensitive information.

## Methodology
The methodology will consist of several phases:
1. **Literature Review:** Analyze existing research on traumatic experiences, therapeutic approaches, and software applications in the psychological field.
2. **Prototype Development:** Create a user-friendly software that allows users to document their experiences.
3. **Evaluation:** Conduct user studies to collect feedback on the functionality and utility of the application. Collaborate with therapists to validate the application.

## Integration of AI (optional)
Furthermore, the work will explore the extent to which AI tools can contribute to the analysis of collected data. A critical examination of the ethical and diagnostic boundaries will also be conducted.

## Expected Results
The expected results of this work are likely to show that a visual timeline can facilitate reflection on traumatic experiences, thus providing a valuable contribution to therapeutic work. The application could be integrated as a supportive tool in therapy, while also addressing the potential risks and challenges associated with using AI analysis tools.

## Timeline
- **Month 1-2:** Literature review and theoretical framework
- **Month 3-4:** Prototype development
- **Month 5:** Conduct user studies and gather feedback
- **Month 6:** Analyze results and finalize the thesis

## Conclusion
This work aims to develop an innovative tool to support therapy based on scientific principles, addressing both psychological and technological needs. The combination of a personal timeline and therapeutic context has the potential to facilitate preparation for therapy sessions and strengthen the therapeutic relationship.
